# Bugfender Recipe Finder App

## Introduction
The Kotlin Recipe Finder App is a demonstration project that showcases efficient Android development using Kotlin Coroutines. This app serves as a practical example for the accompanying article, "Efficient Android Development with Kotlin Coroutines: Building a Recipe Finder App". It highlights the use of Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming, LiveData for reactive UI updates, ViewModel for managing UI-related data, and RecyclerView for displaying a list of recipes.

## Features
- Asynchronous data fetching with Kotlin Coroutines.
- UI state management with LiveData and ViewModel.
- RecyclerView implementation for listing recipes.
- Error handling and progress indication in network requests.

## Setup and Installation
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/ashutosh-makwana/bugfender-recipe-finder-app.git

2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files to resolve dependencies.
4. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Structure
- `Recipe.kt`: Data model representing a recipe.
- `FakeDatabase.kt`: Mock database to simulate recipe data fetching.
- `RecipeViewModel.kt`: ViewModel for managing recipe data.
- `MainActivity.kt`: Main activity that displays recipes and handles UI states.
- `RecipeAdapter.kt`: Adapter for the RecyclerView to display recipe items.
- `activity_main.xml`: Layout file for the main activity.
- `recipe_item.xml`: Layout file for individual recipe items.
